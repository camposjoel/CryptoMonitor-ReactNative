## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to install packages.

Run the following command from the _root_ of the project:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 2: Start the Application

Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
